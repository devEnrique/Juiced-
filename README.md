# Juiced-
iOS app created in xcode using Swift 

This app was created in the Fall 2016 semester for a mobile application class. Juiced! was created in xcode and uses the swift
programming language to bring an app where a user can create a juice with any ingredient provided. The app will calculate how many calories the juice contains and it will also calculate how many calories the user needs for the day. The juice can then be saved to the app by giving it a name.
